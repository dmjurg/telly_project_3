Problems: What tv shows are my friends watching?  
  I'm home sick and want a good show to help pass the time.
  Who can I chat with about the current season of X show?
  I just binged on Y and want to discuss my feelingz.

As a user, I want to be able to:
- Search for specific tv shows

- Browse tv shows?
- Mark shows I'm currently watching
  - Mark shows I want to watch
  - Mark shows I've finished
- Rate said shows
- Connect with friends
- View friends' current/past/to-watch shows
- Find/sort by friends who have seen a specific show
